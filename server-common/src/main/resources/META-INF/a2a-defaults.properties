# These values are used when no other configuration source provides them

# DefaultRequestHandler - Blocking call timeouts
# Timeout for agent execution to complete (seconds)
# Increase for slow agents: LLM-based, data processing, external APIs
a2a.blocking.agent.timeout.seconds=30

# Timeout for event consumption/persistence to complete (seconds)
# Ensures TaskStore is fully updated before returning to client
a2a.blocking.consumption.timeout.seconds=5

# AsyncExecutorProducer - Thread pool configuration
# Core pool size for async agent execution
a2a.executor.core-pool-size=5

# Maximum pool size for async agent execution
a2a.executor.max-pool-size=50

# Keep-alive time for idle threads (seconds)
a2a.executor.keep-alive-seconds=60

# Queue capacity for pending tasks (must be bounded to enable pool growth)
# When queue is full, new threads are created up to max-pool-size
a2a.executor.queue-capacity=100
